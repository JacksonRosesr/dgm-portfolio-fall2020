             I hear that the first editions of many games were coded using only Java Script! I don't have much experience running Java, only a few introductory classes, so I am by no means an expert on how it works but I know the time is worth it. If I can get to a point where I'm confortable usin it, I'm sure it will go a long way! The final projects that were debutted in the pre-class "Open House" in August sure were impressive; I can't wait until I'm able to build responsive programs like those. I want to get started as soon as I can!
